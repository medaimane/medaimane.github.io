# Personal Website

This is my personal website where I can present myself online. Finally, i have been converting it to a progressive web application PWA. Here is the link to visit it [medaimane.github.io](https://medaimane.github.io).

Also we cover on this repository :

* HTML5 Template integration.
* Responsive UI.
* Service worker and Caching.
* Manifest configuration for mobile.
* Github page hosting for account.
* Audits testing (Performance, PWA, Accessibilty, Best practices, SEO), and this is the result :
